We have created a meta-compiler for Java with which developers can create systems designed with the principles of N-Dimensional Architecture. Traditionally, when software developers use the ideas of 3-tier architectures, they organize their systems using one design characteristic. N-Dimensional Architecture is a new technique for designing software systems that organize them using more than one characteristic at the same time. The resulting systems are simplier to understand, but more flexible for future changes and for handling systems that are larger and more complex. The first major features to roll out will be the meta-compiler for the Matrix data-structure and for Matrix-Programming. We plan to release an alpha version for customers to preview in early 2010!"

These one-dimensional architectures organize a system based on only one characteristic of the system, object behavior (is the object a \"view\" object? or is it a \"model\" object?). Multi-dimensional architectures organize a system based on more than one characteristic of a system simultaneously (one of the most well known is Multi-Dimensional Separation of Concerns - MDSOC)." +

Multi-dimensional architectures better manage this complexity by allowing architects to organize these objects in multiple ways. The goal is that the developers of these systems should more easily understand the system organization, reducing the learning curve and thus, development time. We are researching a new form of multi-dimensional architecture called N-Dimensional Architecture with Scaling. We hope this work will provide software architects and developers with new, beneficial ways of designing their software systems." +
