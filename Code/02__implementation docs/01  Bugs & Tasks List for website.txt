o *** DEFAULT CHILD PAGE should not be set using child page id (-1 is given to the default child page). 
	This is bad as the default child page may change, which means we must set the child page id of the new default to -1 change the old default child-page to another id (id's should never change!). 

o IE 8 compatibilty problem - causes the right side of the table to be misaligned, bumped out on the side.
       To fix, I added a tag:
       
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=EmulateIE7" />
        
       This is an important tag, Internet Explorer 8 tries to be more compatible with current standards. But, IE 8 is
             doing something different with html, possible with empty cells rows. So, to make IE 8 emulate IE 7, use this meta tag. 
             The problem this solves deals with the floating image header in the hierarchy product pages. if you dont' use this tag, then 
             the underlying table is misaligned and is bumped out a bit on the right side. This tag solves this problem. But, in the future,
             I need to fix this bug by turning this tag off and figuring out what is incompatible with the html.
