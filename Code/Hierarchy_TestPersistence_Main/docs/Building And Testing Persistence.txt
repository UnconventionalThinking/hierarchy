Building and Testing Persistence
______________________________________________________________________________


1. To Build and Test the Main Persistence project
   a. In the TestPersistence_Main project, run PersistMain_MainTests_Setup
   b. Then, run the junit test for the project

2. To Build and Run the Basic End-to-End tests
   a. Build the Persistence Client project:
       In the TestPersistence_Main project, run PersistClient_MainTests_Setup

   b. start rmiregistery (Java's rmi registry service):
      In your terminal, cd to the base directory where the class file for <My RemoteMethods>.class is located.
      For Hierarchy Persistence, this is in the 'Hierarchy' project. cd to the root dir (it has the class: PersistentMatrixManager_Server in it's build/classes dir)

      Then, use the rmi start script:
        startrmi.bat

      OR, you can manually type in:
        rmiregistry -J-classpath -J.\build\classes & (no '&' for Windows)

   c. Run the Junit Server test:
       In the TestPersistence1_Server project, run PersistTest_02_Server__BasicEndToEndTest

   d. Run the number '02' Junit client tests:
       In the TestPersistence2_Client project, run all PersistTest_02... tests
